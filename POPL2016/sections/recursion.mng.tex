\section{Dependent Types with General Recursion}\label{sec:rec}

In this section we present \name: an extension of \ecore with a
recursion construct.  Recursion 
has a uniform representation on both term level and type level: the
same construct works both as a term-level fixpoint and a recursive type.
The addition of general recursion does not break decidability of
type checking nor type safety. The full specification and proofs of \name
can be found in the supplementary materials of this paper.

\subsection{Syntax and Semantics}

Figure \ref{fig:rec:ext} shows the changes of extending \ecore to
\name with general recursion. The changes are subtle, since we add
only one more primitive, reduction rule and typing rule for general
recursion. Nevertheless general recursion allows a large number 
of programs that can be expressed in programming languages such 
as Haskell to be expressed in \name as well.

For the syntax, we add the polymorphic recursive expression $[[mu x:t.e]]$
to represent general recursion in both terms and types.  The recursive
expression is \emph{polymorphic}, in the sense that $[[t]]$ 
is not restricted to $[[star]]$ but can be any type, 
such as a function type $[[int -> int]]$ or a kind $[[star -> star]]$.
For the operational semantics, we add
the rule \ruleref{S\_Mu} to define the unrolling of recursion
as a one-step reduction. For typing, we
add the rule \ruleref{T\_Mu} for checking the validity of a
recursive term. The rule ensures that the 
recursion $[[mu x:t.e]]$ should have the same type $[[t]]$ as the
binder $[[x]]$ and also the inner expression $[[e]]$.

\subsection{The Two Faces of Recursion}
\label{sec:rec:recur}
\paragraph{Term-level Recursion}

In \name, the $[[mu]]$-operator works as a \emph{fixpoint} on the term
level. By rule \ruleref{S\_Mu}, evaluating a term $[[mu x:t.e]]$ will
substitute all $[[x]]$'s in $e$ with the whole $[[mu]]$-term itself,
resulting in the unrolling $[[e [x |-> mu x:t.e] ]]$. The
$[[mu]]$-term is equivalent to a recursive function that should be
allowed to unroll without restriction. Therefore, the definition of
values is not changed in \name and a $[[mu]]$-term is not treated as a
value. 

Recall the factorial function example in Section
\ref{sec:overview:recursion}.
By rule \ruleref{T\_Mu}, the type of $\mathit{fact}$ is $[[int ->
    int]]$. Thus, we can apply $\mathit{fact}$ to an integer, say $3$,
and will get an integer as the result. In this example, we assume
evaluating the $\kw{if}$-$\kw{then}$-$\kw{else}$ construct and 
arithmetic expressions follows the one-step
reduction. Together with standard reduction rules \ruleref{S\_Mu} and
\ruleref{S\_App}, we can evaluate the term $\mathit{fact}~3$ as
follows:
\begin{align*}
    &\mathit{fact}~3 \\ [[-->]]~& ([[\x : int . @@]]~\kw{if}~
  ~x==0~\kw{then}~1~\kw{else}~x \times \mathit{fact}~(x - 1))~3
  \\ [[-->]]~ & \kw{if}~3==0~\kw{then}~1~\kw{else}~3 \times
  \mathit{fact}~(3 - 1) \\ [[-->]]~& 3 \times \mathit{fact}~(3-1)
  \\ [[-->]]~& \dots [[-->]]~ 6. 
\end{align*}

Note that we never check if a $\mu$-term can terminate or not, which
is an undecidable problem for general recursive terms. The
factorial function example above can stop, while there exist some
terms that will loop forever. However, term-level non-termination is
only a runtime concern and does not block the type checker. In Section
\ref{sec:rec:meta} we show type checking \name is still decidable
in the presence of general recursion.

\paragraph{Type-level Recursion}

On the type level, $[[mu x:t.e]]$ works as a \emph{iso-recursive}
type~\cite{eqi:iso}, a kind of recursive type that is not equal but only isomorphic
to its unrolling. Normally, we need to add two more primitives
$[[fold]]$ and $[[unfold]]$ for the iso-recursive type to map back
and forth between the original and unrolled form. Assume there exist
expressions $[[e1]]$ and $[[e2]]$ such that
\[\begin{array}{lll}
  &[[e1]] &: [[mu x:t.T]]\\
  &[[e2]] &: [[T [x |-> mu x:t.T] ]]
\end{array}\]
We have the following typing results
\[\begin{array}{lll}
  &[[unfold e1]] &: [[T [x |-> mu x:t.T] ]]\\
  &[[fold [mu x:t.T] e2]] &: [[mu x:t.T]]
\end{array}\]
which are derived from the standard rules for recursive types~\cite{tapl}
\[ \inferrule{[[G |- e1 :(mu x:t.T)]] \\ [[G |- T[x |-> mu x:t.T] : star]]}
   {[[G |- unfold e1 : (T[x |-> mu x:t.T]) ]]} \]
\[ \inferrule{[[G |- e2 : T[x |-> mu x:t.T] ]] \\ [[G |- (mu x:t.T) : star]] }
   {[[G |- fold [mu x:t.T] e2 : (mu x:t.T) ]]} \]
Thus, we have the following relation between types of $[[e1]]$ and $[[e2]]$
witnessed by $[[fold]]$ and $[[unfold]]$:
\begin{align*}
  [[mu x:t.T]] \xrightleftharpoons[{[[fold]]~[ [[mu x:t.T]] ]}]
  {[[unfold]]} [[T[x |-> mu x:t.T] ]]
\end{align*}

However, in \name we do not need to introduce $[[fold]]$ and
$[[unfold]]$ operators, because with the rule \ruleref{S\_Mu},
$[[castup]]$ and $[[castdown]]$ \emph{generalize} $[[fold]]$ and $[[unfold]]$.
Consider the same expressions $[[e1]]$ and $[[e2]]$ above. The type of
$[[e2]]$ is the unrolling of $[[e1]]$'s type, which follows the
one-step reduction relation by rule \ruleref{S\_Mu}:
\[ [[mu x:t.T --> T [x |-> mu x:t.T] ]] \]
By applying rules \ruleref{T\_CastUp} and \ruleref{T\_CastDown}, we
can obtain the following typing results:
\[\begin{array}{lll}
	&[[castdown e1]] &: [[T [x |-> mu x:t.T] ]]\\
	&[[castup [mu x:t.T] e2]] &: [[mu x:t.T]]
\end{array}\]
Thus, $[[castup]]$ and $[[castdown]]$ witness the isomorphism between
the original recursive type and its unrolling, behaving in the
same way
as $[[fold]]$ and $[[unfold]]$ in iso-recursive types:
\begin{align*}
  [[mu x:t.T]] \xrightleftharpoons[{[[castup]]~[ [[mu x:t.T]]
  ]}]{[[castdown]]} [[T[x |-> mu x:t.T] ]]
\end{align*}


\subsection{Decidability of Type Checking and Type Safety}\label{sec:rec:meta}
We gave the proof of the decidability of type checking \ecore in
Section \ref{sec:ecore:meta} without requiring strong normalization. The
\cast rules, which rely on checking if
one type can be reduced to another in one step, are critical for decidability. When we introduce
general recursion into the language, if we can make sure that the newly
added and original typing rules are decidable, then the decidability
of type checking still follows in \name.
The type-checking rule \ruleref{T\_Mu} for 
recursion is decidable because its premises only include
decidable typing judgements. 

However, the rule \ruleref{S\_Mu} changes
the one-step reduction, which may affect the decidability of \cast
rules. If the decidability of changed reduction rules still holds, by
following the proof for \ecore, we can show that \cast
rules are decidable in \name. Note that given a recursive term
$[[mu x:t.e]]$, by rule \ruleref{S\_Mu}, there always exists a unique
term $[[e']]=[[e[x|->mu x:t.e] ]]$ such that $[[mu x:t.e -->
    e']]$. Thus, the decidability of one-step reduction still holds,
i.e., Lemma \ref{lem:ecore:unique} holds in \name. Then we can conclude that 
type checking \name is decidable:

\begin{thm}[Decidability of Type Checking \name]\label{lem:rec:decide}
	There is an algorithm which given $[[G]], [[e]]$ computes the
        unique $[[t]]$ such that $[[G |- e:t]]$ or reports there is no
        such $[[t]]$.
\end{thm}

Moreover, it is straightforward to show the type safety of \name by
considering rules \ruleref{S\_Mu} and \ruleref{T\_Mu} during the
induction step of proofs for Theorem \ref{lem:ecore:reduct} and
\ref{lem:ecore:prog}. The type safety of \name is given by
the following theorems:

\begin{thm}[Subject Reduction of \name]\label{lem:rec:reduct}
If $[[G |- e:T]]$ and $[[e]] [[->>]] e'$ then $[[G |- e':T]]$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}[Progress of \name]\label{lem:rec:prog}
If $[[empty |- e:T]]$ then either $[[e]]$ is a value $v$ or there
exists $[[e]]'$ such that $[[e --> e']]$.
\end{thm}
