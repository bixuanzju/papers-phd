We thank all reviewers for their thoughtful comments.

###Let us reemphazise our goal first, since some reviewers are
confused about it. There are at least two potential benefits of using a
PTS-style, unified syntax for core languages:

1)Opening up the rich world of Dependently-Typed Programming
(DTP), as in Coq/Agda/Idris...;

2)*Significantly simplifying core languages*, by eliminating
redundancy between the various syntactic levels.

This paper aims at 2, not 1! In particular we focus on traditional
functional languages like ML or Haskell extended with many interesting
type-level features, but perhaps not the *full power* of dependent
types.

###Logical and programmatic fragments in languages like Zombie or F*
are *tightly coupled*! Thus it's hard to compare only with the
programmatic fragment. For example, in Zombie, the conversion rule
(TConv) for the programmatic part depends on equality proofs, which
are only available in the logical part.

###"why a cast is required for each beta-reduction/expansion at the
type level"

With Type:Type, even without fixpoints, the type-system is
undecidable: it is well-known that with Type:Type leads to paradoxes,
that can encode fixpoints. Thus it is still necessary to control
computation at the type-level for other constructs.

###"The ideas in this paper aren't new."

This paper gives a positive answer to the question: 

"Can we have a calculus comparable in simplicity to PTS that models key
features of modern functional languages (like Haskell and ML), while
preserving type-soundness and decidable type-checking?"

None of the suggested references [1,2,3,4,5] answers this
question. [1] doesn't support decidable type-checking; whereas
[2,3,4,5] are significantly more complex than a PTS-based calculus.

#“The use of general recursion to implement recursive types is
already shown in Cardelli's paper”

*We don't claim to be the first to unify recursion and recursive
types*. The related work acknowledges that others had this idea
before:

"Like λμ⋆ , ΠΣ uses one recursion mechanism for both types and
functions" 

*Our claimed contribution* is a generalization of *iso-recursive types*
that unifies recursion and iso-recursive types. *Cardelli's work
doesn't show this*: Cardelli models *equi*-recursive types (he uses no
casts and/or fold/unfold). The whole point of using iso-recursive
types is to obtain decidable type-checking, which Cardelli doesn't
have.

#We also disagree that the idea of one-step casts is not significantly
different to references [1,2,3,4,5] (or System FC). Part of our
motivation was precisely to come up with a simpler alternative to
System FC casts!  We do agree that related work should discuss these
differences better (currently we only briefly mention that System FC
also has a form of casts).

Essentially, *all cast approaches in System FC and [2,3,4,5] require
equality proofs, while our one-step casts does not*.  *Our one-step
casts lead to a significantly simpler language design* because:

1)Building equality proofs requires various other language
constructs, *adding to the complexity of the language*.

2)It is desirable to ensure that the equality proofs are valid. Otherwise, we
could easily build bogus equality proofs with non-termination, which
could (among other things) endanger type-safety:

_|_ : Int = Char

Solutions to this problem exist. For example, in Zombie, the existence
of a logical fragment guarantees that the proofs are valid. Other
approaches include restricting valid equality proofs to be syntactic
values only [2,4], or having different languages for proofs and terms
[3,5]. However all those solutions *complicate the language
design/metatheory!*


###Much of the criticism in this review assumes that we claim our core
language to be good for DTP, as in Cayenne, Idris, Coq or Agda.

*This assumption is false*. The introduction clearly states:

“A **non-goal** of the current work (although a worthy avenue for
future work) is to use λμ⋆ as a core language for modern DTP languages
like Agda/Idris”

This review also has a large paragraph complaining about missing 
features from FC and features useful for DTP.

It's true that certain features of FC cannot be expressed, *but this
is acknowledged in the paper*. See related work paragraph on System
FC, where we talk about GADTs and equality for example.  We'll
emphasize the limitations against FC/DTP better, and include discussions
on erasability (which we have indeed not mentioned).


###"the paper doesn't discuss the trade-offs involved when allowing
nontermination in dependently-typed languages"

*This isn't true*: we mention the loss of logical consistency as
another trade-off of our work in the introduction (paragraph before
contributions).


###"I found the formalization of explicit casts odd, in particular the
decision to make 'cast up' a value"

In short, the decision to make 'cast up' a value was to retain
type-preservation. If we had a reduction rule, doing something like:

castUp T e --> e

then this would not preserve types (remember that type-equality is
only upto alpha-equivalence in our system). Also, by keeping
castUp as a value, we retain the semantics of iso-recursive types.


###“this surface language lacks type-level computation, meaning that it
cannot take advantage of the main benefits of the core language.”

Actually the surface language takes good advantage of the benefits of
the core language. The encoding of datatypes and case analysis uses
casts and type-level computation steps in a fundamental way: we need
to use casts to simulate fold/unfold, and we also need small
type-level computational steps to encode parametrised datatypes.

###"can anything be said about the connections between this
calculus and step-indexed logical relations?"

We are not sufficiently familiar with step-indexed logical relations
to give a good answer at this time, but thanks for pointing out the
(possible) connection! We'll surely investigate.



#143D

###Please note that casts are mostly meant as a feature of the *core*
language, and aren't meant to be used in the source.  The
contribution/goal of Section 3 is to illustrate how many features of
source languages are encoded via *type-level computation and casts*.
See also the reply to the last point for reviewer B.

Intensive type-level computation would indeed be inconvenient at
the moment (say by allowing casts on the source), but please look at
our discussion in the last paragraph of Section 8 for what can be done.
