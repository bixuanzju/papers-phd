Discuss

\begin{itemize}
\item Compare  with Typed Racket's typed first-class
  classes~\cite{DBLP:conf/oopsla/TakikawaSDTF12}.
\item Compare with Grace's various inheritance mechanisms~\cite{DBLP:conf/ecoop/0002HNB16}, one
  difference is the latter is focused on dynamic semantics, whereas \name
  relies on \bname
\item No formal model of (dynamic) inheritance discussed in \cite{DBLP:journals/jot/NobleBBHJ17}
\item For the ease of meta-theory, we include \rref{D-traitArr1,D-traitArr2}
\item In Section~\ref{sec:typesystem}, we didn't show multi-field record
  selection and field removal. They can all be simulated by term annotations.
\end{itemize}
