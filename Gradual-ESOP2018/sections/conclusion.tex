\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we present a generalized definition of consistent subtyping,
which is proved to be applicable to both polymorphic and top types. Based on the new
definition of consistent subtyping, we have developed a gradually typed calculus
with predicative implicit higher-rank polymorphism, and an algorithm to
implement it.
% We have also shown that our new definition of consistent subtyping
% works for $\tope$ types.
As future work, we are interested to investigate if our results can scale to
real world languages and other programming language features.
% In particular, we are interested to know how to extend our work with more advanced
% features, such as recursive types, union types and intersection types.
% Recent work
% by \citet{castagna2017gradual} on gradual typing with union and intersection
% types in a simply typed setting may shed some light on this direction.
