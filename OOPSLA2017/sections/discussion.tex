Discuss the limitations/issues of \name. The differences from the original trait model.

\begin{itemize}
\item Override: Form a new trait by layering additional methods over an existing
  trait. This operation is an asymmetric sum.
\item Exclusion: forms a new trait by removing a method from an existing trait
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\item Traits have no proper notation of inheritance relationship (no super keyword)
\item Traits have no nice syntax of redefining
\item traits allow annotation of type, then term declarations don't need to
\end{itemize}
