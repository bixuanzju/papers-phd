\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

This paper describes \name: a polymorphic, statically-typed and delegation-based
programming language. \name provides a powerful form of conflict-free multiple
inheritance mechanism called dynamically composable traits. \name is both safe
and flexible. Throughout the paper, we have shown how the mechanisms of \name
improve extensibility design pattern such as Extensible Visitors and Object
Algebras.

There are many avenues for future work. On one hand, we intend to port the core
functionality of \name into a JVM-based compiler. One the other hand, \name is
still very simple, lacking interesting features such as state variables,
recursive types, \textbf{super} keyword, etc. So we are interested to see how
our trait model interacts with those features. Finally we plan to further study
the formal meta-theory of the extended version of \bname.
