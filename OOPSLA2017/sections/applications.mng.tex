\section{Case Study: Modularizing Components in a Small Scripting Language}

%This section shows the expressiveness of \name. 
%We show that features of \name
%(dynamically composable traits, intersection types, the merge operator,
%parametric polymorphism and disjoint quantification) enable extensible designs
%that have been presented in mainstream languages. 
%In particular, \name addresses
%limitations of those languages, making the designs significantly
%simpler. 
To further illustrate the applicability of \name, we present a case study based
on the approach to Object Algebras presented in Section~\ref{sec:OA}. The case
study modularizes several orthogonal features of a small
JavaScript-like language, used by~\citet{poplcook} in his textbook
on Programming Languages. The case study illustrates how various features can be
modularly developed and composed to assemble a complete language with
various operations baked in.


% The second is a case study on embedding a higher-order
% domain-specific language (simply-typed lambda-calculus with conditional and
% constants) with a selectable evaluation order: CBN and CBV. The outcome is an
% evaluator parameterized over the evaluation order. This case study shows that
% features of \name are sufficient for such a seemingly impossible task, which
% usually require fancy types (in particular, GADTs).

\subsection{Overview}

A \textit{feature} is an increment in program
functionality~\citep{zave1999faq,lopez2005evaluating}. Figure~\ref{fig:mini-js}
presents the syntax of the expressions, values and types provided by the
features; each line is annotated with the corresponding feature. Starting from a
simple arithmetic language, we gradually introduce new features and combine them
with some of the existing features to form various languages. Below we briefly
explain what constitutes each feature:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathit{natF}$ and $\mathit{boolF}$ contain, among others, literals,
  additions, if expressions.
% \item $\mathit{boolF}$ introduces Boolean values and if expressions.
\item $\mathit{compF}$ and $\mathit{logicF}$ introduce comparisons between
  numbers and logical conjunction/disjunction.
% \item  introduces logical conjunction and disjunction.
\item $\mathit{varF}$ introduces local variables and variable declarations.
\item $\mathit{funcF}$ introduces top-level functions and function calls.
\end{itemize}
\noindent Besides, each feature is packed with 3 operations: evaluator, pretty
printer, and type checker.

\caption{Overview of the languages we can assemble}
\label{fig:langs}

\end{figure}

Having the feature set, we can synthesize different languages by selecting one or
more operations, and one or more data variants, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:langs}. For example \lstinline{arith} is a simple language of
arithmetic expressions. On top of that, we also define an evaluator, a pretty
printer, and a type checker. Note that for some languages (e.g.,
\lstinline{simplenat}), since they have only one kind of value, we only define an
evaluator and a pretty printer. We thus obtain 12 languages and 30 operations in
total. The complete language \lstinline{mini-JS} has all the features and
operations. Besides, we also define a new algebra with the combined behavior of
all the operations.

% Figure~\ref{fig:dependency} gives an overview of the reusable components of the
% implementation, and the subtyping/inheritance relations of the languages we can
% assemble. The interactions between languages and features are revealed by the
% arrows. Below we briefly explain what features/operations each language supports:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \lstinline{ArithL} is a simple language of arithmetic expressions,
%   directly inherited from the feature $\mathit{Arith}$. We define an evaluator
%   and a pretty printer.
% \item \lstinline{BoolArithL} extends \lstinline{ArithL} with the feature
%   $\mathit{Bool}$. Apart from the evaluator and pretty printer, we define
%   another operation: type checker. Thus \lstinline{BoolArithL} is illustrative
%   of solving the Expression Problem.
% \item \lstinline{VarArithL} extends \lstinline{BoolArithL} with the feature
%   $\mathit{Var}$. We define an evaluator, a pretty printer, and a type checker.
% \item \lstinline{Mini-JS} is the complete language that inherits all the
%   features and operations.
% \end{itemize}

From Figure~\ref{fig:langs} we can also see the subtyping/inheritance relations
between each language. For example, since the feature set of \lstinline{arith}
contains that of \lstinline{natbool}, we can say \lstinline{arith} extends
\lstinline{natbool}, and the former is a supertype of the latter. Indeed,
operations defined for \lstinline{arith} can safely apply to expressions of \lstinline{natbool}.


% For example, the leftward arrow between
% \lstinline{BoolArithL} and \lstinline{ArithL} says that \lstinline{BoolArithL}
% extends \lstinline{ArithL}, while the rightward dashed arrow between them says
% that \lstinline{ArithL} is a subtype of \lstinline{BoolArithL}. We thus obtain 4
% languages and 11 operations in total.

\subsection{Evaluation}

To evaluate \name's implementation of the case study,
Figure~\ref{fig:sloc} compares the number of source lines of code
(SLOC, lines of code without counting empty lines and comments) for
\name's \emph{modular} implementation with the vanilla
\emph{non-modular} AST-based implementations in Haskell. The Haskell
implementations are just straightforward AST interpreters and
operations, which duplicate code across the multiple language
implementations.

Since \name is a new language, we
had to write various code that is provided in Haskell by the standard library,
so they are not counted for fairness of comparison. In the left part, for each
feature, we count the lines of the algebra interface (number beside the feature
name), and the algebras for the operations. In the right part, for each
language, we count the lines of defining the AST, and those to combine previously
defined operations. For example, here is the code that is needed to make the
\lstinline{arith} language.

\lstinputlisting[linerange=537-547]{../examples/case_study.sl}% APPLY:linerange=ARITH

\noindent We only need 8 lines in total: 2 lines to define the AST
(\lstinline{Arith}), and 6 lines to combine the operations.

Therefore, the total SLOC of \name's implementation is the sum of all the
lines in the feature and language parts (237 (SLOC of all features) plus 84
(ASTs and operations)). Although \name is considerably more verbose than a
functional language like Haskell, \name's modular implementation for 12 languages and 30
operations in total reduces approximately 58\% in terms of SLOC. The reason is
that, the more frequently a feature is reused by other languages directly or
indirectly, the more reduction we see in the total SLOC. For example,
$\mathit{natF}$ is used across many languages. Even though \lstinline{simplenat}
itself \textit{alone} has almost twice SLOC ($40 = 7+23+7+3$) than that of Haskell (which
has 29), we still get a huge gain when implementing other languages.

\subsection{Putting all together}

% With all the components ready, we can assemble them at will to cook a language
% with whatever features we want. For example, we hope by now the reader can share
% our feeling that this is indeed a simple and modular way to cook a language
% incrementally.

To demonstrate the usage of the final language \lstinline{MiniJS}, here is a function that
makes sure ``well-typed programs cannot go wrong'':
\lstinputlisting[linerange=-]{}% APPLY:linerange=SUPER_DEF
It type checks the program before passing it to the evaluator and pretty
printer.

% we first create a program that
% uses all the features the language supports now.
% \lstinputlisting[linerange=-]{}% APPLY:linerange=FINAL_TEST
% The concrete syntax of the program is shown in the comment above. We assume a
% pre-defined function environment (\lstinline{fenv}) containing the definition of
% the \lstinline{add1} function.

% Finally we apply it to the program we have just created:
% \lstinputlisting[linerange=738-739]{../examples/case_study.sl}% APPLY:linerange=TEST_TEST
% Everything works as expected!

\subsection{Parameterizing Expressions by the Evaluation Order}

We now turn to the second case study. In this case study, we embed a
higher-order domain-specific language inside \name. Our object language in this
case study is typed lambda calculus with conditional and constants. This time,
the embedding not only demonstrates the extensibility, as is shown in the first
case study, but also object types, expressed in the meta-language (\name) and
manifestly ensuring well-scoped and well-typed expressions in the object
language. What is more, the evaluator over the object expressions is type
preserving by construction. The embedding of typed languages is directly
inspired by Kiselyov's lecture notes~\cite{kiselyov2012typed} on the
"tagless-final" approach to embedding languages.

\paragraph{Well-typed object expressions} One important issue with such
embedding is how to deal with binders in the object language. In general there
are two options, one can either use deBrujin indices~\cite{}, or higher-order
abstract syntax (HOAS)~\cite{}. Each option has its cons and pros, but for this
particular case study, we find HOAS convenient. HOAS represents object language
abstractions as \name abstractions and object variables as \name variables. By
utilizing the infrastructure of the meta-language, we are free of issues such as
variable capture. Here is the interface of the object language.
\lstinputlisting[linerange=-]{}% APPLY:linerange=TYPED_LAMBDA
Embedded object expressions of type \lstinline{A} are represented as \name
values of the type \lstinline{Expr[A]}. The \lstinline{bot} constructor, which
represents non-terminating computation, is there for the purpose of illustrating
different evaluation strategies.

A careful reader may notice that the \lstinline{ExprAlg} interface has no
abstractions. This is intentional! Evaluators with different evaluation
strategies only differ in the interpretation for abstractions, as will be shown
later on. For this reason, \lstinline{lam} is moved to a separate interface of
its own.
\lstinputlisting[linerange=-]{}% APPLY:linerange=ABSTRACTION


\paragraph{Well-typed evaluator}
The benefit of typeful embedding shows up when defining the evaluator.
\lstinputlisting[linerange=-]{}% APPLY:linerange=TYPED_EVAL
Unlike the evaluator in the first case study, there is no need for a separate
\lstinline{Value} datatype for values, as they are directly modeled by \name
values. Note that the resulting evaluator is \textit{type preserving} by
construction.

\paragraph{Call-by-name, call-by-value}
Our evaluator defined in the first case study inherits the evaluation strategy
from the meta-language. We now show call-by-name and call-by-value evaluators.
The two evaluators are quite alike, sharing most of the code. As said before,
the only difference is the interpretation for \lstinline{lam}.
\lstinputlisting[linerange=-]{}% APPLY:linerange=CBN_CBV
The call-by-name \lstinline{lam}, when applied, will receive an unevaluated
argument expression, use it as it is. The call-by-value \lstinline{lam}, as in
the call-by-name evaluator, receives an unevaluated argument expression,
evaluates it before passing its result to the abstraction body \lstinline{f}.

Now to make an evaluator parameterized over the evaluation order, we just take a
trait \lstinline{o} with unknown implementation, compose it with other language
features.
\lstinputlisting[linerange=-]{}% APPLY:linerange=MAKE_EVAL
Here is the call-by-name evaluator at work:
\lstinputlisting[linerange=-]{}% APPLY:linerange=CBN_TEST
On the other hand, \lstinline{(evaluator evalBindCBV ex)()} would result in a
infinite loop. The complete code with several examples can be found in the
supplementary materials.

\jeremy{I am afraid we don't seem to have many advantages over OCaml's version,
  because we don't really have higher-kinded types, we cannot make a AST type
  for this example, though \lstinline{makeEvaluator} seems to be one advantage }
