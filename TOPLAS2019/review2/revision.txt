Recommendation #1: Minor Revision

Associate Editor
Comments for Author:
Thank you for your careful revision. The reviewers have just a few more small
comments that should be addressed. Hence I am recommending that you prepare a
minor revision that addresses the reviewers' suggestions and resubmit the paper.

Note: I passed on the revised appendix to the reviewer who asked for it, and
that reviewer is satisfied with the improved appendix. So nothing further is
needed to address that comment, except fixing the broken reference.

Comments to the Author

The authors have satisfactorily addressed most of the issues I raised.

I have one major comment (at the end), and a few minor comments on the updated version:

14, footnote 8: I would not say "interpretation": this is not about two
different interpretations of a concept, but two different (and, unfortunately,
opposite) notations.

Reply: Fixed. We use "notation" rather than "interpretation" as suggested.

26 line 35: "measure metric" should be "measure".

Reply: Fixed.

26 line 39: "the full proofs can be found in ??"; similar problem at 39 line 15

Reply: Fixed.

39 line 41: "when comparing two judgments of typing terms of the same size": the
first "of" should be deleted.

Reply: Fixed

(This paragraph seems rather closely paraphrased from a similar section of
Dunfield and Krishnaswami (2013); it is safer to write prose from scratch, and
then compare to prior work, than to paraphrase directly.)

Major comment:

The appendix seems to be absent in the revised version. I would like to verify
that the authors made some changes to proofs that they mentioned in their
response, but cannot. At least, the references to the appendix should not appear
as "??".

Reply: Fixed. We attached the appendix and all references to the appendix are fixed.

Comments to the Author

I am almost entirely satisfied with the changes.

My final comment is that footnote 3 reads as a non­sequitur now:

"In a type system with impure features, such as non­termination or exceptions,
the encoded types can have valid inhabitants with side­effects. However, that is
beyond the scope of this paper"

What is beyond the scope of the paper? I would just say instead that the caveat
to saying polymorphism means certain builtin datatypes can be avoided is that
you only get the *lazy* version of those datatypes.

Important Issues
================

p. 6
"Definition 2.2 (Declarative Consistent Subtyping of Siek and Taha [2007])"

This is still confusing because of the above phrase "of Siek and Taha [2007]".
This is not a definition in Siek and Taha [2007], it is a proposition.
Basically, you need to make it clear that *you* are creating a strawman
definition based on Siek and Taha's Proposition 2, which is helpful to *you*
because generalizing it leads to your definition of consistent subtyping. The
distinction is that it is *your* choice to treat Prop. 2 like a definition, not
Siek and Taha's. You should say that you're creating a strawman and explain why,
and edit Definition 2.2 to instead say:

"Definition 2.2 (Strawman for Declarative Consistent Subtyping)"

Reply: Fixed. We made the change as suggested.

p. 11

Similarly, the sentence "Unfortunately, the original declarative definition of
Siek and Taha (Definition 2.2) does not work well with our definitions of
consistency and subtyping for polymorphic types." is again incorrect because it
was a proposition, not a definition, in their work. Also, the phrasing sounds
like you're blaming Siek and Taha for something they didn't do. Instead, write
something like "The strawman version of consistent subtyping (Definition 2.2)
does not work well with our definitions of consistency and subtyping for
polymorphic types."

Reply: Fixed. We made the change as suggested.

Minor Edits
===========

p. 1

"The algorithmic version employs techniques developed by Dunfield and
Krishnaswami on higher­rank polymorphism to deal with instantiation."
==> change "on" to "for"
"The algorithmic version employs techniques developed by Dunfield and
Krishnaswami for higher­rank polymorphism to deal with instantiation."

Reply: Fixed.

"Python [Vitousek et al. 2014]" You should also cite MyPy.

Reply: Fixed. We added the citation as suggested.

p. 11

"One of our design principles is that subtyping and consistency and orthogonal
..."
==> change "and" to "are"
"One of our design principles is that subtyping and consistency are orthogonal
..."
