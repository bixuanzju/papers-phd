\begin{abstract}
  Consistent subtyping is employed in some gradual type systems to validate type
  conversions. The original definition by \citeauthor{siek2007gradual} serves as
  a guideline for designing gradual type systems with subtyping. Polymorphic
  types \`a la System F also induce a subtyping relation that relates
  polymorphic types to their instantiations. However
  \citeauthor{siek2007gradual}'s definition is not adequate for polymorphic
  subtyping. The first goal of this paper is to propose a generalization of
  consistent subtyping that is adequate for polymorphic subtyping, and subsumes
  the original definition by \citeauthor{siek2007gradual}. The new definition of
  consistent subtyping provides novel insights with respect to previous
  polymorphic gradual type systems, which did not employ consistent subtyping.
  The second goal of this paper is to present a gradually typed calculus for
  implicit (higher-rank) polymorphism that uses our new notion of consistent
  subtyping. We develop both declarative and (bidirectional) algorithmic
  versions for the type system. The algorithmic version employs techniques
  developed by \citeauthor{dunfield2013complete} for higher-rank polymorphism to
  deal with instantiation. We prove that the new calculus satisfies all static
  aspects of the refined criteria for gradual typing. We also study an extension
  of the type system with static and gradual type parameters, in an attempt to
  support a variant of the dynamic criterion for gradual typing. Assuming a
  coherence conjecture for the extended calculus, we show that the dynamic
  gradual guarantee of our source language can be reduced to that of \pbc,
  which, at the time of writing, is still an open question. Most of the
  metatheory of this paper, except some manual proofs for the algorithmic type
  system and extensions, has been mechanically formalized using the Coq proof
  assistant.
