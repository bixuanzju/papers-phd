\label{sec:conclusion}

We have proposed \fnamee, a type-safe and coherent calculus with disjoint
intersection types, BCD subtyping and parametric polymorphism. \fnamee improves
the state-of-art of compositional designs, and enables the development of highly
modular and reusable programs. One interesting and useful further extension
would be implicit polymorphism. For that we want to combine
Dunfield and Krishnaswami's approach~\cite{dunfield2013complete} with our bidirectional type system.
We would also like to study the parametricity of \fnamee. As we have seen in
\cref{sec:failed:lr}, it is not at all obvious how to extend the standard
logical relation of System F to account for disjointness, and avoid potential
circularity due to impredicativity. A promising solution is to use step-indexed
logical relations~\cite{ahmed2006step}.
