\section{\name: Syntax and Semantics}
\label{sec:typesystem}


In this section we formally present the syntax and semantics of \name. We focus
on the differences and improvements over \oname. Notably, \name has a much more
powerful subtyping relation compared to \oname. The new subtyping relation is
inspired by BCD-style subtyping, but with two noteworthy differences: subtyping
is coercive (in contrast to traditional formulations of BCD); and it is extended
with records. Furthermore \name removes the restrictions on ordinary types and
top-like types, and does not require a well-formedness judgement restricting
intersections to be disjoint. A final difference is a new target language with
explicit coercions inspired by the work of \citet{biernacki2015logical}.

\subsection{Syntax}

\Cref{fig:source} shows the syntax of \name, with the differences from
\oname \hl{highlighted}. The \name calculus is essentially a simply-typed
$\lambda$-calculus (STLC) extended with intersection types, the merge operator
and singleton records. For brevity of the meta-theoretic study, we do not
consider primitive operations on natural numbers, or other primitive types.
They can be easily added to the language, and our prototype implementation is
indeed equipped with common primitive types and their operations.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering

\begin{tabular}{llll}\toprule
  Types & $[[A]], [[B]], [[CC]]$ & $\Coloneqq$ & $[[nat]] \mid [[Top]] \mid [[A -> B]]  \mid [[A & B]] \mid \hlmath{[[ { l : A } ]]}$ \\
  Expressions & $[[ee]]$ & $\Coloneqq$ & $[[x]] \mid [[i]] \mid [[Top]] \mid [[\x . ee]] \mid [[ee1 ee2]] \mid [[ee1 ,, ee2]] \mid [[ee : A]] \mid \hlmath{[[ { l = ee } ]]} \mid \hlmath{[[ee.l]]}  $ \\
  Typing contexts & $[[GG]]$ & $\Coloneqq$ & $[[empty]] \mid [[GG , x : A]]$ \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}

  \caption{Syntax of \name}
  \label{fig:source}
\end{figure}


Metavariables $[[A]], [[B]], [[CC]]$ range over types. Apart from STLC types,
\name includes a top type $[[Top]]$; intersection types $[[A & B]]$; and
singleton record types $[[ {l : A} ]]$. Metavariable $[[ee]]$ ranges over
expressions. Apart from STLC expressions, \name includes the merge of two
expressions $[[ee1]]$ and $[[ee2]]$, written $[[ee1 ,, ee2]]$; singleton records $[[ {l = ee}]]$; and
record selections $[[ ee.l ]]$.


\subsection{Declarative Subtyping}

The main difference between \name and \oname lies in its subtyping relation,
given in \cref{fig:subtype_decl}. We ignore the \hl{highlighted} parts, and
explain them later in \cref{sec:elaboration}.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \drules[S]{$[[A <: B ~~> c]]$}{Declarative subtyping}{refl, trans, top, rcd, arr, andl, andr, and, distArr, distRcd, topArr, topRcd}
  \caption{Declarative specification of subtyping}
  \label{fig:subtype_decl}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{BCD-style Subtyping.}
The subtyping rules are essentially those of the BCD type
system~\citep{Barendregt_1983}, extended with subtyping for singleton records.
\Rref{S-top,S-rcd} are directly ported from \fname~\citep{alpuimdisjoint}.
\Rref{S-arr} for function subtyping is standard. \Rref{S-andl,S-andr,S-and} for
intersection types axiomatize that $[[A & B]]$ is the greatest lower bound of
$[[A]]$ and $[[B]]$. \Rref{S-distArr} is perhaps the most interesting rule.
This, so-called the ``distributivity'' rule, describes the interaction between
the subtyping relations for function types and those for intersection types. In
the same vein, \Rref{S-distRcd}, which is not found in the original BCD system,
prescribes the distribution of records over intersection types. The two
distributivity rules are the key to enable nested composition. The
\rref{S-topArr} rule is standard in BCD subtyping, and the new
\rref{S-topRcd} plays a similar role for record types.

%The remaining two
%\rref{S-topArr,S-topRcd} may appear strange at first sight, but enable
%a compact and elegant formulation of algorithmic subtyping (c.f. \cref{sec:alg}). \jeremy{any
%  other justifications for these two rules?}

\paragraph{Non-algorithmic.}
The subtyping relation in \cref{fig:subtype_decl} is clearly no more than a
specification due to the two subtyping axioms: \rref{S-refl,S-trans}. A sound
and complete algorithmic version is discussed in \cref{sec:alg}. Nevertheless,
for the sake of establishing coherence, the declarative subtyping relation is
sufficient.


\paragraph{No Ordinary Types.} Apart from the extra subtyping rules, there is an
important difference from the \oname and \fname subtyping relations. The subtyping relations of both \oname and \fname employ an
auxiliary unary relation called $\mathsf{ordinary}$, which plays a fundamental
role in both calculi for ensuring coherence and obtaining an
algorithm~\citep{Davies_2000}. For reasons that will become clear in
\cref{sec:cohe}, \name improves over \oname and \fname in that it discards the
notion of ordinary types completely; this yields a clean and elegant formulation
of the subtyping relation. Another minor difference is that due to the addition
of the transitivity axiom (\rref{S-trans}), \rref{S-andl,S-andr} are
simplified: an intersection type $[[A & B]]$ is a subtype of both $[[A]]$ and
$[[B]]$, instead of the more general form $[[ A & B <: CC]]$.

% \paragraph{Properties of Subtyping}
% The subtyping relation in \cref{fig:subtype_decl} is vacuously
% \textit{reflexive} and \textit{transitive}.


% \paragraph{Example}
% The following example shows the derivation tree of the subtyping example
% presented in \cref{sec:overview}. \jeremy{A derivation of the nested composition
%   example? }



\subsection{Typing of \name}


\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
\drules[T]{$[[GG  |- ee => A ~~> e]]$}{Inference}{top, lit, var, app, anno, merge, rcd, proj}
\drules[T]{$[[GG  |- ee <= A ~~> e]]$}{Checking}{abs, sub}
  \caption{Bidirectional type system of \name}
  \label{fig:type_system}
\end{figure}

The type system for \name, which is based on the bidirectional type system for
\oname, is shown in \cref{fig:type_system}. Again we ignore the \hl{highlighted}
parts for now. The main difference to \oname is the absence of a well-formedness
judgement. Unlike \oname, which requires a well-formedness judgement to ensure
that all intersection types are disjoint, \name only requires a disjointness
check at the merge operator. Non-disjoint types such as $[[nat & nat]]$ are
allowed in other parts of the program.

\begin{comment}
Unlike the development of \oname, which first presents a type assignment
specification, \Cref{fig:type_system} directly present the bidirectional type
system of \name.
Unfortunately, we found that their declarative type
system is incoherent in nature (even with all the syntactic restrictions).
\jeremy{perhaps add a counter example somewhere?} Again, the reader is advised
to continue ignoring the gray-shaded parts until \cref{sec:elaboration}.
\tom{The above story is a bit confusing to me. Is it the case that the
     \oname paper already was aware of the coherence problem with its
     declarative type system and for that reason (and inference) presented
     a bidirection type system as well? If so, that's not clear.} \jeremy{I
     remember at one point Bruno and I believed the declarative system is
     coherent, it's just hard to prove. Then I found a counterexample. That was
     after \tname paper.  }
\end{comment}

\paragraph{Typing Rules and Disjointness.} As with traditional bidirectional type
systems, we employ two modes: the inference mode ($[[=>]]$) and the checking
mode ($[[<=]]$). The inference judgement $[[GG |- ee => A]]$ says that we can
synthesize a type $[[A]]$ for expression $[[ee]]$ in the context $[[GG]]$. The checking
judgement $[[GG |- ee <= A]]$ checks $[[ee]]$ against $[[A]]$ in the context
$[[GG]]$. The disjointness judgement $[[A ** B]]$ (its definition is
unremarkable and found in the appendix) in \rref{T-merge}
states that the types $[[A]]$ and $[[B]]$ are disjoint. The disjointness judgement is
important in order to rule out ambiguous expressions such as $\mer{1}{2}$.
Most of the typing rules are standard.
%We refer
%the reader to their papers for further explanation.


\paragraph{No Well-Formedness Judgement.} A key difference from the type system
of \oname is the complete omission of the well-formedness judgement. In \oname,
the well-formedness judgement $[[GG |- A]]$ appears in both \rref{T-abs,T-sub}.
The sole purpose of this judgement is to enforce the invariant that all
intersection types are disjoint. However, as \cref{sec:cohe} will explain, the
syntactic restriction is unnecessary for coherence, and merely complicates the
type system. The \name calculus discards this well-formedness judgement
altogether in favour of a simpler design that is still coherent. So an
expression such as $1 : [[nat & nat]]$ is accepted in \name but rejected in
\oname. This simplification is based on an important observation: incoherence
can only originate in merges. Therefore disjointness checking is only necessary in
\rref{T-merge}.


\subsection{Elaboration Semantics}
\label{sec:elaboration}

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
\begin{tabular}{llll} \toprule
  Target types & $[[T]]$ & $\Coloneqq$ & $[[nat]] \mid [[Unit]] \mid [[T1 * T2]] \mid [[T1 -> T2]] \mid [[ {l : T} ]]$ \\
  Typing contexts & $[[G]]$ & $\Coloneqq$ & $[[empty]] \mid [[G , x : T]]$ \\
  Target terms & $[[e]]$ & $\Coloneqq$ & $[[x]] \mid [[i]] \mid [[unit]] \mid [[\x . e]] \mid [[e1 e2]] \mid [[<e1, e2>]] \mid [[{ l = e }]] \mid [[e.l]] \mid [[c e]]$ \\
  Coercions & $[[c]]$ & $\Coloneqq$ & $ [[id]] \mid [[c1 o c2]] \mid [[top]] \mid [[topArr]] \mid [[< l >]] \mid [[c1 -> c2]] \mid [[<c1, c2>]]$ \\
  &  &  $\mid$ & $  [[p1]] \mid [[p2]] \mid [[{l : c}]] \mid  [[ distRcd l ]] \mid [[distArr]]  $ \\
  Target values & $[[v]]$ & $\Coloneqq$ & $[[\x.e]] \mid [[unit]] \mid [[i]] \mid [[<v1, v2>]] \mid [[(c1 -> c2) v]] \mid [[distArr v]] \mid [[topArr v]] $ \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
  \caption{\tname types, terms and coercions}
  \label{fig:target}
\end{figure}

The operational semantics of \name is given by elaborating source expressions
$[[ee]]$ into target terms $[[e]]$. Our target language \tname is the standard
simply-typed call-by-value $\lambda$-calculus extended with singleton records,
products and coercions. The syntax of \tname is shown in \cref{fig:target}. The
meta-function $| \cdot |$ transforms \name types to \tname types, and extends
naturally to typing contexts. Its definition is in the appendix.


\paragraph{Explicit Coercions and Coercive Subtyping.}
The separate syntactic category for explicit coercions $[[c]]$ is a distinct
difference from the target language of \oname. Coercions express the conversion
of a term from one type to another. Because of the addition of coercions, the
grammar contains explicit coercion applications $[[c e]]$ as a term, and various
unsaturated coercion applications as values. The use of coercions is inspired by
the work of \citet{biernacki2015logical}, and useful for the new semantic
proof of coherence based on logical relations.
Since our subtyping relation is more complex than that of
theirs, we have more forms of
coercions.\footnote{Coercions $[[p1]]$ and $[[p2]]$ subsume the first and second
  projection of pairs, respectively.} The subtyping judgement in
\cref{fig:subtype_decl} has the form $[[A <: B ~~> c]]$, which says that the
subtyping derivation of $[[A <: B]]$ produces a coercion $[[c]]$ that converts
terms of type $[[ |A| ]]$ to type $[[ |B| ]]$. Each subtyping rule has its own
specific form of coercion.

%The meaning of the different forms of coercions becomes clear in \tom{Section
%  TODO} \jeremy{it's a paragraph, how to refer it?} which explains coercive
%subtyping.\bruno{Why not discuss the form of coercions directly here?}

\paragraph{No Top-like Types.}
Apart from the syntactic category of explicit coercions, there is a notable
difference from the coercive subtyping of \oname. Both in \oname and \fname,
\textit{top-like types} are introduced and used in \rref{S-andl,S-andr}. Because
of their syntactic proof method, \oname and \fname require special treatment of top-like types
in order to retain coherence. However in \name, as with ordinary types, we do
not need this kind of ad-hoc treatment, thanks to the adoption of a more powerful
proof method (c.f. \cref{sec:cohe}).


\paragraph{Target Typing.}

The typing of \tname is entirely standard. Only the typing of coercion
applications, shown below, deserves attention:
\begin{mathpar}
\drule{typ-capp}
\end{mathpar}
Here the judgement $[[c |- T1 tri T2]]$ expresses the typing of coercions, which
are essentially functions from $[[T1]]$ to $[[T2]]$. Their typing
rules correspond exactly to the subtyping rules of the source language \name. We
refer the interested reader to the appendix for the definition of coercion
typing.

%   \caption{Coercion reduction}
%   \label{fig:coercion_red}
% \end{figure}


\paragraph{Target Operational Semantics and Type Safety.}

The operational semantics of \tname is mostly unremarkable. What may be
interesting is the operational semantics of coercions, whose reduction rules are
shown in the appendix.
\begin{mtheorem}[Type Safety of \tname]
  If $[[e]]$ is a well-typed \tname term and $[[e -->> e']]$, then $[[e']]$ is a
  value or $\exists e''$ such that $[[e' -->> e'']]$.
\end{mtheorem}

\paragraph{Elaboration.}
\begin{comment}
The subtyping judgement in \cref{fig:subtype_decl} has the form $[[A <: B ~~>
c]]$, which says that the subtyping
derivation of $[[A <: B]]$ produces a coercion $[[c]]$ that is used to convert a
term of type $[[ |A| ]]$ to type $[[ |B| ]]$. Each
subtyping rule has its own specific form of coercion.
\end{comment}
We are now in a position to explain the elaboration judgements $[[GG |- ee
=> A ~~> e]]$ and $[[GG |- ee <= A ~~> e]]$ in \cref{fig:type_system}. The only
interesting rule is \rref{T-sub}, which applies the coercion $[[c]]$ produced by
subtyping to the target term $[[e]]$ to form a coercion application
$[[c e]]$. All the other rules do straightforward translations between
source and target expressions.


To conclude, we show two lemmas that relate \name expressions
to \tname terms.
% (Note that in this and subsequent sections, we only provide
% a proof sketch for each lemma and theorem. We refer the interested reader
% to our Coq development for the full proofs.)

\begin{lemma}[Coercions preserve types]
  If $[[A <: B ~~> c]]$, then $[[c |-  |A| tri |B|]]$.
  \label{lemma:sub-correct}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By structural induction on the derivation of subtyping. \qed
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}[Elaboration type soundness]  \leavevmode
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If $[[GG |- ee => A ~~> e]]$, then $|\Gamma| \vdash e : |A| $
  \item If $[[GG |- ee <= A ~~> e]]$, then $|\Gamma| \vdash e : |A| $
  \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By structural induction on the derivation of typing. \qed
\end{proof}
